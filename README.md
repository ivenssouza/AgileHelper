# Agile Helper API

This API was created to help with agile projects.
It is under contruction and I am using Python 3, Django, Ninja.
For data base in the beggining I used Postgree but changed to MySQL.

## What is Working (or should be working)
For now it is possible to do some activities related to the Planning meeting.
- POST and GET Sprints.
- POST and GET Stories.
- POST and GET Planning.
- POST and GET Poker Round.
- POST and GET Vote Story Points.
- Finish a Poker Round and find the average points voted.

## To do List (Not in priority order)
- There is a part for create a new User done, but must be refined.
- Create a login endpoint.
- Relate Users to Planning.
- Relate User to Vote.
- Create rules to validate the Vote and relate it to a user.
- Create the Stand Up Daily meeting stuff (Data base models are created, but maybe will change during development).
- Anything else that comes to my mind.
- Any suggestion received that could.
